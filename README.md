# Security

This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity, cryptography, and
information security labs completed as part of my Bachelor of
Information Technology (Networking & Cybersecurity) at the
University of Technology Sydney (UTS).

The focus is on security fundamentals, applied cryptography,
information security management, and basic incident analysis.

> Network-layer security concepts are covered separately in my
> [Networking Labs](https://github.com/MagTro29/Networking).
